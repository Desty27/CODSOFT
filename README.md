- **Movie Genre Classification**: In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), in conjunction with the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. The goal is to automatically assign one or more genres to a movie based on the provided textual description. This can be valuable for categorizing and organizing movies in databases, recommendation systems, and content filtering.
- **Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection**
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing historical transaction data, weâ€™ll train a model to identify suspicious patterns and flag potentially fraudulent activities.
- **Bank Customer Churn Prediction**
The primary goal of this project is to help banks proactively identify customers who might churn. By understanding the factors that lead to churn, banks can take targeted actions to retain valuable customers.
- **SMS Spam Collection**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately distinguishes between legitimate (ham) messages and unwanted (spam) messages in a dataset of SMS messages.
