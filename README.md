## Contents

- **Movie Genre Classification**: In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), in conjunction with the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. The goal is to automatically assign one or more genres to a movie based on the provided textual description. This can be valuable for categorizing and organizing movies in databases, recommendation systems, and content filtering.
