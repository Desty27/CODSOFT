# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the **Bank Customer Churn Prediction** project! In this repository, we focus on predicting whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave) or not. We also identify important features that contribute to customer churn.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to help banks proactively identify customers who might churn. By understanding the factors that lead to churn, banks can take targeted actions to retain valuable customers.

## Dataset

We use a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes related to bank customers. The dataset includes features such as transaction history, customer demographics, and account details.

## Contents

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We analyze the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering**: We preprocess and engineer relevant features for model training.
3. **Model Building**: We experiment with different machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn.
4. **Model Evaluation**: We assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. **Feature Importance**: We visualize and interpret the importance of features using SHAP (SHapely Additive exPlanations) values.
6. **Deployment**: We deploy the best-performing model using Streamlit for active usage by bank staff.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the analysis and model development process.
3. Run the Streamlit app to interactively predict customer churn.

## Model Deployment

The best-performing model is deployed using Streamlit. You can access the deployed app and make predictions based on customer information.
