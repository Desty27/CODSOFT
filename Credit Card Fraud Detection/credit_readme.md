# Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing historical transaction data, we'll train a model to identify suspicious patterns and flag potentially fraudulent activities.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent ones. It includes features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and anonymized features derived from the transaction details.

- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Features**: V1, V2, ..., V28 (anonymized features), Time (timestamp), Amount (transaction amount), Class (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent)

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, engineer features, and train the model.

2. To preprocess the data and train the model using Python scripts:
   ```
   python src/preprocessing.py
   python src/model.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune hyperparameters as needed.

## Results
Our trained model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set, with Y% recall for fraud detection. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

## Conclusion
Detecting credit card fraud is crucial for financial institutions and consumers alike. This project provides a foundation for building an effective fraud detection system using machine learning.
